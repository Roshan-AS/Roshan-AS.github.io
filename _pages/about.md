I am an Assistant Professor in the Department [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.buffalo.edu) at the [University at Buffalo, SUNY](https://buffalo.edu). I have started at UB in Fall, 2023 and I am currenlty looking to build my lab @ UB (more on this [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/prospective/)).

I received my Ph.D. degree from UCSD, where I was advised by Prof. Dinesh Bharadia. My research interests are the intersection of wireless sensing and machine learning with applications to the IoT, indoor navigation, XR, and robotics. 

I work towards designing novel Wireless sensors and Wireless Systems that can provide a new source of information about the sensed physical world systems. My research vision is to design and develop reliable and scalable sensing systems that connect the digital world with our physical world.
