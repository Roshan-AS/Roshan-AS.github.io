We will do some quick and interactive exercises to brush the fundamentals of signals and systems that is critical to understand the rest of the material. We would then focus more on wireless signals (Radio Frequency) based mobile computing and IoT systems that can aid in a broad spectrum of applications ranging from localization, navigation, breathing, heart-rate estimation, autonomous driving perception and many more to come. We will also cover algorithms that can use Inertial-Measurement-Units (IMUs) for tracking that can be used in health, sports and other applications. We will wrap the class with some latest algorithms across the intersection of ML and IoT systems.</p> <p>The objective of the course is to enable students to:</p> <ul> <li>Gain fundamental knowledge of signal and systems.</li> <li>Gain fundamental knowledge of wireless signals.</li> <li>Understand mono-static and bi-static wireless sensor systems.</li> <li>Learn basic signal processing algorithms</li> <li>Introduction to Machine Learning based algorithms for IoT and Mobile computing.</li> <li>Prepare for studying advanced Wireless topics, and a career in the field of Wireless Sensors. At the end of this course, each student should be able to:</li> <li>Have a good overall picture of signals and systems in general and wireless signals in particular.</li> <li>ave a rough idea of how various signals behave and where they are used for sensing: IMUs, Acoustic Sensors, and Wireless (RF) Sensors.</li> <li>Know how to do signal processing in MATLAB and/or Python.</li> <li>Know how to do basic signal analysis of popular wireless protocols (WiFi, BLE, UBW, cellular).</li> <li>Know how to use popular signal processing tools ranging from FFT, MUSIC, CFAR, and more</li> <li>Start reading more advanced/research-oriented signal processing and wireless systems materials.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2> <p><strong>For undergraduate students</strong>: CSE 250 and (EAS 305 or MTH 411 or STA 301) <strong>For graduate students</strong>: There are no formal perquisites, but it is expected that graduate students have a familiarity with systems programming, signal processing, and some optimization algorithms. Students need to have some basic knowledge of calculus and probability theory, data structures, and algorithms. In addition, <span style="color:red">they must be proficient in either Python or MATLAB programming</span>.</p> <hr> <h3 id="reference-textbooks">Reference Textbooks</h3> <ul> <li>Oppenheim, Alan V., and A.

Latest submission (4 days late) will receive at most 60% of max points even if it’s all correct; 0 points if more than 4 days late.</li> <li> <strong>The workload is heavy, so start the assignments, especially the project assignments, early!</strong> Excuses that you did not have enough time for an assignment will not be considered. Extraordinary circumstances will be considered at the discretion of the instructor, contact the instructor via E-mail if you think these apply to you.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Teams: <strong>Teams are allowed for the two programming project assignments and the final project only</strong> and will be grouped at the beginning of the semester and are NOT subject to change during the whole semester. If you do not satisfy with your team in the middle of the semester, send an email to the instructor and explain your situation. We may regroup your team and/or ask for an in-team peer review base on the situation.</li> <li>Exams: If you miss an exam because of sickness or similar reasons, visit a physician and obtain a note detailing the period during which you were medically incapable of taking the exam. Notify the instructor immediately via e-mail or telephone (voice mail) if you are going to miss an exam, before the exam takes place unless medically impossible. See the instructor as soon as you return to class. If you miss an exam without a valid excuse, you will receive a zero grade for that exam. <strong>No make-up exam will be available without a valid excuse.</strong> </li> <li>No extra work in the next semester will be given to improve your grade.</li> <li>Regrading policy: <ul> <li>Homeworks: Homework grades will be posted on UBLearns. You can look up graded homework from the UBLearns. Questions about homework/report grades should be sent on piazza via private post within <strong>one week</strong> after the grade is posted on UBLearns. If you are not satisfied with the instructor’s response, you should contact the instructor no later than 3 days after instructor’s response.</li> <li>Programming assignments (PA)/Final Project: Grades for the programming assignments/project will be posted on UBLearns. If you have questions about your grade, you should contact the TAs on piazza via private post or during their office hours within <strong>one week</strong> after the grade is posted on UBLearns. If you are not satisfied with the instructor’s response, you should contact the instructor no later than 3 days after instructor’s response.</li> <li>Exams: Exams will <strong>NOT</strong> be returned. Exam grades will be posted on UBLearns, and you will be able to see your exam during the instructor’s office hours. If you have questions about your grade, you should contact the instructor by email or during office hours within <strong>the time period specified</strong> after the grade is posted on UBLearns.</li> <li>No regrade requests will be considered after the deadlines mentioned above.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="grading-policies">Grading Policies</h2> <p>(Tentative and subject to change) Each student must correctly answer all the questions in the AI Quiz within a month (Feb 24), in order to receive any final grade other than F.
